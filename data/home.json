  "introduction": "hi i'm büyücü and this is a collection of things i've experienced\nmy ratings are mostly based on personal enjoyment and slightly quality\nthey are not absolute and may change over time\nmost things before ~2018 are not included because i don't remember clearly\n\nif a game has an ending and no/low replayability = story game\nwhat counts as a story game or not is debatable\nvisual novels are not games\n\nthe site is still a work in progress so some parts may break or not work\ndark reader makes some elements blend in but its generally ok\nfeel free to add me on other platforms",
